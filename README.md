## Project Overview

**Project Title**: AtliQ Hospitality
**Level**: Advance  
**Tool Used**: Power BI  
**Dataset**: AtliQ Hospitality

This project demonstrates data visualization and business intelligence skills using Power BI. It showcases how to analyze hotel performance KPIs like Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, Realisation %, and Cancellation %, providing management with actionable insights through interactive dashboards. This project is ideal for beginners and intermediate users aiming to strengthen their data storytelling and dashboard development skills.

## Objectives

1. **Build a dynamic Power BI dashboard**: Create visualizations for hotel key performance indicators (KPIs).
2. **Explore Operational Metrics**: Understand trends and patterns in revenue, occupancy, ADR, and booking platforms.
3. **Provide Business Insights**: Help the management make informed decisions based on visual analytics.
4. **Develop Interactive Reports**: Implement filters by city, hotel category, week, and booking platform.

## Project Structure

### 1. Dataset Overview

  - **Revenue**
  - **RevPAR** (Revenue Per Available Room)
  - **ADR** (Average Daily Rate)
  - **Occupancy %**
  - **Realisation %**
  - **Cancellation %**
  - **City-wise, Hotel-wise, and Platform-wise Data**
  - **Weekly and Monthly Trends**

- Timeframe covered: **May 2022 to July 2022**.

### 2. Dashboard Features

- **KPI Cards**: 
  - Revenue
  - RevPAR
  - DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)

- **Filters/Slicers**:
  - By **City**
  - By **Hotel Category** (Luxury / Business)
  - By **Week**
  - By **Booking Platform**

- **Visualizations**:
  - **Revenue vs RevPAR Comparison** by Category
  - **Realisation % vs ADR** by Booking Platform
  - **RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy %** Trends (Weekly and Monthly Line Charts)
  - **Hotel-wise Performance Tables** (Revenue, ADR, Occupancy, Realisation %)
  - **Cancellation % Analysis**

- **Day Type Analysis**:
  - Weekend vs Weekday Occupancy and ADR.

### 3. Key Business Questions Answered

- Which city and hotel generated the most revenue?
- How does performance differ between luxury and business hotels?
- Which booking platforms deliver higher realization rates?
- How do RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy % vary over months and weeks?
- What is the trend of cancellations across different properties?

## Findings

- **Higher Occupancy on Weekends**: Weekend stays show significantly better occupancy rates compared to weekdays.
- **Consistent ADR**: ADR remains relatively stable across months and booking platforms.
- **Realisation Rates**: Realisation percentages are stable around 70%, suggesting efficient revenue collection strategies.
- **Cancellation Challenges**: An average cancellation rate of 25% highlights opportunities to improve booking policies.
- **Platform Performance**: Certain booking platforms yield higher realization compared to others.

## Reports

- **Hotel Performance Dashboard**: Track performance KPIs city-wise, hotel-wise, and category-wise.
- **Booking Platform Analysis**: Understand impact of different booking channels on hotel revenue and realization.
- **Revenue & Occupancy Trend Reports**: Analyze seasonality and time-based performance.
- **Cancellation Summary Report**: Identify trends and high-risk areas for cancellations.

## Conclusion
